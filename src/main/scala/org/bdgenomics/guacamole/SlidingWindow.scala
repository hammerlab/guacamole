/**
 * Suppose we have a set of loci on a given contig and some objects that are mapped to that contig, and at each locus we
 * want to look at the regions that overlap a window of a certain number of bases surrounding that locus. This class
 * implements this "sliding window" functionality.
 *
 * After instantiating this class, call [[SlidingWindow.setCurrentLocus( )]] repeatedly for each
 * locus being considered. After calling this method, the [[SlidingWindow.currentRegions]] property will contain the
 * objects that overlap the current locus.
 *
 * To enable an efficient implementation, we require that both the sequence of loci to be considered and the iterator
 * of objects are sorted.
 *
 * @param halfWindowSize Number of nucleotide bases to either side of the specified locus to provide regions for. For
 *                       example, if halfWindowSize=5, and our currentLocus=100, then currentRegions will include regions
 *                       that map to anywhere between 95 and 105, inclusive. Set to 0 to consider only regions that
 *                       overlap the exact locus being considered, with no surrounding window.
 *
 * @param rawSortedRegions Iterator of regions, sorted by the aligned start locus.
