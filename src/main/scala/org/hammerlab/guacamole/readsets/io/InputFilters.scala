/**
 * Filtering reads while they are loaded can be an important optimization.
 *
 * These fields are commonly used filters. For boolean fields, setting a field to true will result in filtering on
 * that field. The result is the intersection of the filters (i.e. reads must satisfy ALL filters).
 *
 * @param overlapsLociOpt if set, include only mapped reads that overlap the given loci
 * @param nonDuplicate include only reads that do not have the duplicate bit set
 * @param passedVendorQualityChecks include only reads that do not have the failedVendorQualityChecks bit set
 * @param isPaired include only reads are paired-end reads
 * @param minAlignmentQualityOpt Minimum Phred-scaled alignment score for a read
