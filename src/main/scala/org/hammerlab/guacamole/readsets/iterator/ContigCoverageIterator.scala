/**
 * [[SkippableLociIterator]] that consumes [[Interval]]s (sorted by start-position) and emits a [[Coverage]] at each
 * covered locus, indicating how many intervals overlap (and start at) that locus. Overlaps are given a grace-margin of
 * `halfWindowSize`.
 *
 * One ([[Locus]], [[Coverage]]) tuple is emitted for each locus where the underlying intervals (and `halfWindowSize`)
 * yield a non-empty [[Coverage]]: intervals contribute 1 to [[Coverage.depth]] for each locus they overlap
 * (± halfWindowSize) and 1 to [[Coverage.starts]] for the first such locus.
 *
 * In cases where this iterator's [[SkippableLociIterator.skipTo]] method is called while it is emitting elements (e.g.
 * when this iterator is made to proceed through loci discontinuously, to restrict calculation to specific loci-ranges),
 * [[ContigCoverageIterator]] can land in the middle of some of its input [[Interval]]s, emitting their first
 * contributions to [[Coverage.depth]] at loci that are not the start of those [[Interval]]s. In these (and all) cases,
 * [[Interval]]s contribute to [[Coverage.starts]] on the first locus where they contribute to
 * [[Coverage.depth]] (even if this is in the middle of the [[Interval]] due to upstream loci-restrictions and
 * skipping).
 *
 * @param intervals Single-contig-restricted, start-position-sorted [[Iterator]] of [[Interval]]s.
