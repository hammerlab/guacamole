/**
 * An allele (alt) at a site in the genome. We also keep track of the reference allele (ref) at this site.
 *
 * Usually alt != ref, but in some cases, such as force calling positions with no variant reads, we can have
 * alt == ref.
 *
 * Indels are supported in the usual VCF style, in which ref.length != alt.length. ref.length and alt.length are > 0
 * (e.g. an insertion is represented as A -> ACC) and therefore end > start. The length of the
 * reference allele determines the size of the region.
 *
 * NOTE: We currently evaluate only a single alternate at each site at a time, i.e. the mixtures whose likelihoods we compute
 * are always just a reference and at most one alternate allele. If we extend this to mixtures with multiple alts, we
 * should change this class to contain any nuber of alts.
 *
 * @param referenceContig the contig (chromosome)
 * @param start the position of the allele
 * @param ref reference allele, must be nonempty
 * @param alt alternate allele, may be equal to reference
