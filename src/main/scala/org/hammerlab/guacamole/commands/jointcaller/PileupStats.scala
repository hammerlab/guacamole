/**
 * Statistics over a PileupElement instances (a pileup).
 *
 * This is not a case class because we do not intend for it to be serialized, and we want to get an error if we try.
 *
 * We can consider sequenced alleles of any reference length. For example, if we are evaluating support for a 10-base
 * deletion, we want the keys returned by `allelicDepths` method to be the sequenced alleles aligning to that
 * 10-base region; in particular the reference allele would be length 10. The length of the `refSequence` attribute
 * establishes the reference length to be considered.
 *
 * @param elements elements from a pileup. They should all be positioned at the same locus. The alleles considered will
 *                 align at this locus + 1.
 * @param referenceSequence reference bases. The length determines the size of alleles to consider. The first element should
 *                    be the reference base at locus elements.head.locus + 1.
