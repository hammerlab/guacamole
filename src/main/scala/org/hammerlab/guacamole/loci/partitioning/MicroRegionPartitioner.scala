/**
 * Assign loci from a LociSet to partitions, where each partition overlaps approximately the same number of "regions"
 * (reads mapped to a reference genome).
 *
 * The approach we take is:
 *
 *  (1) chop up the loci uniformly into many genomic "micro partitions."
 *
 *  (2) for each micro partition, calculate the number of regions that overlap it.
 *
 *  (3) using these counts, assign loci to real (Spark) partitions, assuming approximately uniform depth within each
 *      micro partition.
 *
 *  Some advantages of this approach are:
 *
 *  - Stages (1) and (3), which are done locally by the Spark master, are constant time with respect to the number
 *    of regions (though linear in the number of micro-partitions).
 *
 *  - Stage (2), where runtime does depend on the number of regions, is done in parallel with Spark.
 *
 *  - Accuracy vs. performance can be tuned by setting `accuracy`.
 *
 *  - Does not require a distributed sort.
 *
 * @param regions: RDD of reads to base the partitioning on.
 * @param numPartitions Number of partitions to split reads into.
 * @param microPartitionsPerPartition Long >= 1. Number of micro-partitions generated for each of the `numPartitions`
 *                                    Spark partitions that will be computed. Higher values of this will result in a
 *                                    more exact but more expensive computation.
 *                                    In the extreme, setting this to greater than the number of loci (per partition)
 *                                    will result in an exact calculation.
